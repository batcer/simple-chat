# Simple Chat App with React, MobX and Dexie 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses MobX for state management and Dexie for storing messages locally in IndexedDB.

To runs the app locally in the development mode, run `npm start` 
in the project directory and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Further improvements may be:
0. populate local DB with mock data with https://dexie.org/docs/Dexie/Dexie.on.populate
1. talking and syncing with backend
2. authentication and multiuser support
3. editing and deleting messages
4. group chats
5. advanced message formatting, including adding images
